Wanderlust was an interactive installation piece designed to invoke exploration and discovery through interaction with physical objects. The user assumed the role of a hiker climbing up a mountain, and by using three different interfaces (a hiking stick, climbing sliders, and mounted binoculars), the user was able to interact with the environment. I worked on this project with a team of 9 of my fellow RIT students with backgrounds including visual design, industrial design, and interactive media development.
