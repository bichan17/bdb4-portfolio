This site is an ecommerce platform built to showcase and sell a new line of designer wallpaper. Due to its image-heavy nature, many performance considerations had to be made to allow the site to support high resolution files across a wide variety of devices. Addtionally, a lot of emphasis was placed on making sure that the site ran smoothly and the visual effects looked consistent no matter how the site was being viewed. Be sure to check out the [product detail pages][pdp]{:target="\_blank"} at least! Content entry is based on a modular archetecture which allows the client to easily create pages with new layouts when new wallpaper collections are released.
