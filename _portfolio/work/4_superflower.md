Superflower is a design studio that creates wallpaper patterns from photographic investigations of the natural world. The site is an e-commerce platform built to showcase and sell Superflowerâ€™s designs. Due to its image-heavy nature, performance considerations had to be made to allow the site to support high-resolution files across a variety of devices. Content entry is based on a modular architecture, allowing the client to easily create pages with new layouts when a new wallpaper collection is released.
