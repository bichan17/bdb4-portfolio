Made in collaboration with GOAL Studio and the [Museum of Modern Art in Detroit][mocad], Daily Rush is the home for MOCADâ€™s experimental web series where they publish recent and commissioned works by artists from Detroit and beyond. In order to let the artwork shine as the focal point of the site, I kept things relatively simple by using javascript templates powered by [handlebars.js][handlebars] to render the front end layouts and [Kirby CMS][kirby] to control content entry on the backend.
