This project is a collaboration between myself, GOAL Studio, and the [Museum of Modern Art in Detroit][mocad]. It is the home for MOCAD's experimental web series where they publish recent and commisioned works by artists in Detroit and elsewhere. For this project, I wanted to keep things relatively simple by using javascript templates powered by [handlebars.js][handlebars] to handle the front end layouts and [Kirby CMS][kirby] to handle content entry on the backend.
