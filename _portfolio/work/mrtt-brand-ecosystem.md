The Marriott Brand Ecosystem is the framework built to power the relaunching of Marriott Hotels brand sites. All of the brand sites share the same extendable modular codebase built on top of Wordpress, which makes production faster and the brand websites easily maintained. This project was created at [BBH NY][bbh] and I contributed to it heavily during my time there.
