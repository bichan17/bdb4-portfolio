The Time Sensitive podcast's goal is to not only provide an interesting and thought provoking interview, but to deliver a media-rich experience, adding a visual element to each episode. This site is the home for those experiences. The backend is made with Wordpress and each episode can be made in a modular style, allowing them to be built with images and related content interwoven into the transcript.
